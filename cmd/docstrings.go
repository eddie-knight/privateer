Privateer CLI Quickstart
------------------------
This tool enables the quick execution of Privateer Raids,
with a shared input and output if multiple are executed.
Read more about the vision for Raids in our official documentation:
https://github.com/privateerproj/privateer/README.md

The "sally" command will start all requested raids.

You may also use this tool to streamline the creation of
a new Raid using the generate-raid command, or
the creation of Strikes for a Raid using generate-strike.
Review the help documentation for each command to learn more.
